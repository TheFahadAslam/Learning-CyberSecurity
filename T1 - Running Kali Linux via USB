To begin with, we have to install Kali Linux
{ Why Linux? 

The biggest reason we turn to Linux is because it is far more accessible to a wider range of people than Windows OS offers. 
Linux is free, open-source, and provides a well-integrated command-line interface for users to customize the OS.
This means anyone can modify Linux to create their programs and software. Since the most important thing for a hacker is not to be tracked. 
Linux is easy to install and works well on old and weak systems; therefore, hackers frequently buy old laptops or systems, install Linux, perform their work, and then dispose of the device,
However, this does not work well for other operating systems.

There are different methods to install Kali Linux. But, we would use a USB for work.

This doesn't end here, Now to run the Kali Linux on the System 
Now, you have to go into your BiOS to change the Boot Sequence, to make the USB option Primer than Harddisk(normally the Boot Sequence set the HardDisk 1st, then others )

There are two primary methods to access BIOS on modern Windows computers, and understanding how to access the BIOS is crucial for troubleshooting and configuring your PC's firmware settings.
Method 1 involves restarting your computer and pressing a specific key during the boot process. This key varies by manufacturer but is typically one of the following: F1, F2, F10, DEL, or ESC. It's essential to press the correct key as soon as the manufacturer's logo appears, but before the operating system loads, to successfully enter the BIOS setup.
Method 2 leverages the advanced startup options within Windows to navigate to the BIOS without needing to hit a specific key at boot. To use advanced startup to access BIOS through Windows settings, follow these steps:
Open Settings by clicking the Start menu and selecting the gear icon.
Go to Update & Security > Recovery.
Under Advanced Startup, click "Restart now." The computer will reboot to a special menu.
Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings.
Click UEFI firmware settings, then click Restart to change the settings in the BIOS.

1. Disable secure boot (if enabled)
2. Change the Boot Sequence and then Make the USB come first. Then SAVE change and APPLY and allow stable Boot.
